# accenture-virtual-intern
This repo contains only Task:2 of the virtual intern i.e., Data Cleaning and Modelling.
Tool used for the task is MS-EXCEL.
Repo contains a set of data sets, all containing different columns and values, as well as a data model that shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables. Final Dataset file is cleaned and ready for analysis.
Following are the steps taken to clean the data:
1. Removing columns that have a high number of missing values
2. Removing rows and columns with erroneous values
3. Changing the data type of some values within a column
4. Finally, removing columns which are not relevant to this task and merging all the datasets to create a single cleaned csv file ready for analysis and visulization.
